Takeaways:

1. The python's function `str.isalnum()` checks whether a given string / character is alphanumeric.
2. This is a two pointer problem, where you scan left and right at the same time. The standard solution is slight better in time complexity becuase it has less loop iterations, while maintaining a O(N) time.
